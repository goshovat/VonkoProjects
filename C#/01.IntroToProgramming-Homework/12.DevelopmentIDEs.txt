Eclipse - The most popular IDE for Java. In my opinion it is far from the best. It can run on Windows, 
Mac and Linux. Much lighter than Visual Studio, but with much less capabilities. Although it has some advantages-
it can automatically create constructor for a class from it's defined fields. It can also create automatically getter
and setter methods. 

IntelliJ IDEA - In my mind the best Java IDE ccreated. It is created by JetBrains, the developers of the most popular
PHP IDE. IntelliJ IDEA is much better than Eclipse and much similar to Visual Studio, especially the ultimate version.
It provides great intelliscence, easy to learn shortcuts anf good integration for all kinds of Java projects.

PHP Storm - The best PHP IDE ever created. Developed by the creators of IntelliJ IDEA, PHP Storm is almost a complete
equivalent to Visual Studio for the PHP programming world.

Web Storm - One of the best IDE for JavaScript development(for example NodeJS). It is debatable whether it is better
than Visual Studio for JavaScript development. Just like Visual Studio it provides great dynamic intelliscence, almost
by itself writes all your code.

SublimeText - It is not exactly IDE, but a very good code redactor. With the proper settings it can become quite powerful, 
of course nowhere near Visual Studio or PHP Storm. Its best quality is are that it is light. SublimeText is 
excellent for quickly opening and ammending files in different programming languges. 

Mastering one of the powerful IDEs is essential for a good programmer. The proper control of the intelliscence and 
IDE shortcuts can save the programmer a lot of time, unnecessary efforts and trouble in writing the code. Fortunately
the IDEs become more and more intelligent and begin to wrtie most of the code instead of the developers. The focus 
of the developer should be on the thinking, not on the writing.

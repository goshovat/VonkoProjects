    Consciousness is already conscious. It is the
    unmanifested, the eternal. The universe, however,
    is only gradually becoming conscious. Conscious-
    ness itself is timeless and therefore does not evolve.
    It was never born and does not die. When con-
    sciousness becomes the manifested universe, it
    appears to be subject to time and to undergo an
    evolutionary process. No human mind is capable
    of comprehending fully the reason for this pro-
    cess. But we can glimpse it within ourselves and
    become a conscious participant in it. 
    Although the unmanifested realm of pure
    consciousness could be considered another dimen-
    sion, it is not separate from this dimension of
    form. Form and formlessness interpenetrate. The
    unmanifested fl  ows into this dimension as aware-
    ness, inner space, Presence. How does it do that?
    Through the human form that becomes conscious
    and thus fulfi  lls its destiny.
     The next step in human evolution is not inev-
    itable, but for the fi  rst time in the history of
    our planet, it can be a conscious choice. Who is
    making that choice? You are. And who are you?
    Consciousness that has become conscious of
    itself.
